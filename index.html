        <h1>CSS EXPLAINED</h1>
        <p>CSS(Cascading style sheets) is the code used to style web content. 
        It helps the designer choose colors,styles locations for different content. 
        It is used to style the HTML elements </p>

        <h2 id="subtopic">So What is CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS is a style sheets language.We use CSS to selectivey design HTML elements with colors for 
            example we can choose to make a pragraph red or change the font of a certain heading
        </p>
        <h2>How to connect an HTML page to a CSS style sheet</h2>
        <p>In order to effect the CSS intended for any HTML element,we need to apply the CSS to the HTML document.
            Otherwise,the styling won't change the appearance of the HTML page. To achieve this we have two alternatives;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>we can write the CSS directly in the HTML page</li> 
           <li>we can create a relationship between the two separate pages by linking them</li> 
        </ol>
        <p>open the html file and include the following between the <head> tags.
            link href="nameofstylespage.css" rel="it's description"
        </p>
        <h2 class="anatomy">Anatomy of a CSS ruleset </h2>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="CSS ruleset">
        <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset often referred to as a set</p>
        <p>The main elementsof the ruleset are as follows</p>
        <ol>
            <li>selector: This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</li>
            <li>Declaration: This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</li>
            <li>properties: These are ways in which you can style an HTML element.</li>
            <li>Property value: To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>Note some other important parts of the syntax</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. </li>
            <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
            <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of selectors</h3>
        <p>There are many types of selectors</p>
        <table>
            <tbody><tr>
                <th>selector name</th>
                <th>what does it select</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)</td>
                <td>All HTML elements of the specified type.</td>
                <td>p
                    selects <p></td>

            <tr>
                <td>ID selector</td>
                <td>The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique.</td>
                <td>#my-id
                    selects <p id="my-id"> or <a id="my-id"></td>

            <tr>
                <td>Class selector</td>
                <td>The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page.</td>
                <td>.my-class selects <p class="my-class"> and <a class="my-class"></td>
